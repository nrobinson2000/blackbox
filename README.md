# blackbox
> An elegant IoT project built with the Particle Photon.
-------------------------------------------------------

I started `blackbox` on 2017-05-19. I wanted to create a project using the
Particle Photon, and I wanted to create a sophisticated 3D-printed enclosure.
After scoring an antenna
[like this one on Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/944) that included
a U.FL adapter from the wireless card on an old PC, I was determined to make
a project that would utilize it.
