# Project Log

## 2017-05-20
I started `blackbox` on 2017-05-18. I wanted to create a project using the
Particle Photon, and I wanted to create a sophisticated 3D-printed enclosure.
After scoring an antenna
[like this one on Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/944) that included
a U.FL adapter from the wireless card on an old PC, I was determined to make
a project that would utilize it. After some testing I found that my Photon gets
significantly better WiFi signal when using the U.FL antenna.

I then started working on the enclosure.
Using [Tinkercad](https://tinkercad.com), I eyeballed the measurements and
designed an initial prototype. The breadboard fit in snugly, as did the antenna
as well, but the lid was too large and the micro USB hole was too low.
As this was a prototype, I used below-satisfactory settings, and I hadn't
bothered to change the tape on the build plate.

With the next
